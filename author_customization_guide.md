# üë§ Customize the Author Attribution in the Blogger Theme

### 2. Locate the Author Attribution Code

In your Blogger theme's JavaScript section, look for a line that looks like this:

```js
authorDisplay.innerHTML = `<a class='author-name' href='https://www.blogger.com/profile/01795026804926642553' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>By: MorMandarin</a>`;
```

### 3. Replace It with Your Profile

Change the `href` attribute and display name to your own:

```js
authorDisplay.innerHTML = `<a class='author-name' href='https://www.blogger.com/profile/YOUR_PROFILE_ID' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>By: YourName</a>`;
```

#### Example:

```js
authorDisplay.innerHTML = `<a class='author-name' href='https://www.blogger.com/profile/12345678909876543210' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>By: Jane Doe</a>`;
```

## üîß Optional: Where to Place the Code

This script typically lives at the end of the theme's XML or in a separate `<script>` block near the closing `</body>` tag.

You can edit this in **Theme ‚Üí Edit HTML**.

---

## üï∫ Optional: Dynamic Author Name (Advanced)

If you'd prefer to pull the author name directly from Blogger's system (limited compatibility), you can try:

```xml
<data:post.author.name/>
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This works only in HTML widgets, not JavaScript.
